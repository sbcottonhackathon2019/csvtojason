#### 						Hackathon 2019

##### *Project Brief*

​	Hackathon participants will create and populate a small (10-100MB) data lake in the cloud with flat files and/or semi-structured data (files should be KB/MB in scale). They will then create tools and user interfaces for exploring, manipulating and visualizing the data. 



##### *My Contribution*

​	My task was to create a type script code that converts an HTML and CSV files to JSON. For HTML, I imported a random HTML site and saved it as a new file under test data. Then, I wrote a type script code that converted this file to JSON using this parser.

For CSV, I imported a data containing all lottery winners and their winning numbers and saved it as a .csv file. Then I wrote a function that can convert any CSV file to JSON using this parser.
